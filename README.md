## Project Overview
---
An Amazon retailer would like know the most popular categories of products being sold on Amazon.com and which types products are gaining what type of interactions from Amazon shoppers. These types of analysis and insights are crucial to guide retailers' focus on what products to sell given the virtually "unlimited" merchandise category options.

## Problem Statement
What is the problem you are solving and what is the goal.

## Data Sources
The product details dataset provides product details for each unique product offering on Amazon.com. The key detail we'll be focusing on are the Categories of for each product.

The e-commerce sales dataset provides information on about client interactions such as, whether a customer viewed, liked, or purchased a product.

We'll be using both datasets do analysis on Category frequency and products that received shopper interactions.

- [product_details shortened .csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientist97/e-commerece-sales-data-2024/data?select=product_details.csv)
- [E-commerece sales data 2024.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientist97/e-commerece-sales-data-2024/data)

## Hypothesis:
I hypothesize that since there are so many different type of product categories, there will not be"1" clear top product category across all category types. Also, I think that of the top few/most fequent categories will have the most product interactions( views, likes, purchases) across the board.

## Data Cleaning / Preparation
In the initial data preparatiion phase, the following tasks were performed:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Removal of irrelevant columns in product details dataset
3. Handling missing values
   - `column_1` has 123 missing values REEEEEMMMOOOVEEE THHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSS remove this 
   - Verify no products with missing Product IDs
4. Data cleaning and formatting
   - Find products with missing Category information and fill in "Other" as Category to not remove valuable information from analysis
  
   - 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

## Data Analysis & Visualizations
Include some interesting code/features worked with
```sql
  SELECT * FROM table1
  WHERE cond = 2;
```

## Results / Conclusion

## Recommendations
Based on the the analysis, the following actions are recommended
- Invest in indnsjkd
- Listen todfdf
- Implement survey vfdvf

## Limitations / Challenges
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue because they would have negatively affected....There are a still few outliers - remaining outliers were manged by fndjvnfdnvjk extropalation
